Use the 2 layer comps in the assessment.psd (creative/assessment.psd) for visual layout and style guide.

All images should be combined to a sprite.

Use sass to create the styles.css as your external style sheet.

Use javascript and the provided JSON (stats.json) to display all the dynamic content (text) within each 
section of the module and to add functionality to the tabs "Summary" and "Member page traffic"

You may use jquery or any other JS framework

Bonus - convert the module to render responsively on mobile/tablet and incorporate any animations as you see fit.
